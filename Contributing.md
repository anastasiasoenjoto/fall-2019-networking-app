## Values
To build a platform where people looking for employment or professional opportunities can get connected with each other, post their work experiences and apply for jobs.  


## Norms:

### Communication: 
#### Frequency: 
daily (Tag the group when messaging so that can get notifications)
#### Time to responding to a direct message:
Responding to messages directed to them within 30 minutes, exceptions are allowed. 
#### Standups schedule:
Every other day by video chatting.

### How we work:
Meet once a week: Friday at 4pm.
Check updates on slack.

### How we resolve conflicts: 
Schedule meetups with team-members or communicate through slack/ video chat and talk about the different ideas openly, then post marity vote which should serve the interest for the project as a whole. 

### How we reach consensus: 
Lay out all different ideas, narrow down the ones that are most relevant or easier to start with. Then, post a majority vote which aims on the well-rounded development of the project as a whole. 


### Sprint cadence:
2 weeks/ sprint.

### Done: 
when all codes have been tested out and no bugs/errors. Also everything specified in each individual engineer’s stories has been completed. 

### What to do when a member is failing to deliver on their obligations to the team:
Talk to that person and figure out what is going on. If it was because of a personal emergency, the person can pick up the work which they should have completed. Else, the person gets a warning and if does not improve on fulfilling their responsibilities on time, will invite the professor to step into the situation.  

### Rules to prioritize the Product Backlog:
Start with the basic features. Also, balance the load, no challenging parts back to back. Make sure every team member’s area of work in the same sprint is relevant to each other’s and covers one area’s features.
